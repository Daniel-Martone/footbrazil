          The Brazil's national team, founded in 1915 is with no doubt one of
          the biggest Brazilian symbol, as known as "Canarinho",
          "Verde-Amarela", "Brasilzão", among others.

          What most say its the greatest Brazilian title of all time, the 70s
          world cup was hosted in Mexico.
        </p>
        <p>
          After a disaster in the 66s world cup, Brazil came to achieve its 3rd
          world cup in a 12 years time span, being the first national team to
          have 3 world titles, as, winning the Jules Rimet, that was planned to
          be given to the first three-time champion team. After some years, the
          Jules Rimet was stolen and melt.
        </p>
        <p>
          An easy game for Brazil against Italy, by the time also two-times
          world champion, garanteed the title for brazil in a 4-1 match.
